# Common Package Reorganization

## Overview

The common package has been successfully reorganized into separate files based on their functional categories for better maintainability and organization.

## File Structure

```
common/
├── common.go          # Main package declaration and documentation
├── config.go          # Configuration loading functions
├── config_test.go     # Tests for configuration functions
├── currency.go        # Currency formatting functions
├── currency_test.go   # Tests for currency formatting
├── db.go             # Database configuration and connection
├── db_test.go        # Tests for database functions
├── time.go           # Time handling and timezone functions
├── time_test.go      # Tests for time functions
```

## File Details

### `common.go`
- Package declaration and documentation
- Comments explaining the organization structure

### `config.go`
- `LoadMaxExpense()` - Loads and parses MAX_EXPENSE environment variable
- `LoadTime()` - Loads TIME environment variable with fallback to current time

### `currency.go`
- `FormatRupiah(amount int64) string` - Formats numbers as Indonesian Rupiah with proper thousand separators

### `db.go`
- `DatabaseConfig` struct - Database connection configuration
- `LoadDatabaseConfig()` - Loads database config from environment variables
- `ConnectDatabase(cfg *DatabaseConfig)` - Establishes database connection

### `time.go`
- `Loc` variable - Asia/Jakarta timezone location
- `Now() time.Time` - Current time in Jakarta timezone

## Testing

Each file has comprehensive test coverage:
- **Config tests**: Environment variable loading, error handling
- **Currency tests**: Various amount formatting scenarios
- **DB tests**: Configuration loading (connection tests require real DB)
- **Time tests**: Timezone handling and current time functions

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Functions grouped by purpose
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Smaller, focused files
3. **Clear Separation**: Each file has a single responsibility
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Each category has dedicated test coverage
5. **Better Documentation**: Clear file structure and purpose

## Migration Impact

- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ No breaking changes to public APIs
- ✅ All tests pass (weekly, monthly, common)
- ✅ Project builds successfully
- ✅ Improved code maintainability

The reorganization maintains full backward compatibility while providing a much cleaner and more maintainable code structure.
